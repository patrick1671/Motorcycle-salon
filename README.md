### Motorcycle-salon


## Link to live version: https://motorcycle-salon.000webhostapp.com/#/models

I wanted to build an appliaction that allowed users to configure and order motorcycle in a virtual salon.
I started this process by using the 'create-react-app' then adding 'react-router'. 

One of the main challenges I ran into was to keep a flow of a configuration data between components using database placed in 'list' file. It leads me to use local storage to keep data consistent. 

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, basics of Typescript, SCSS, JSX.
